Usually, people may consult doctor and he will identify their illness and 
prescribe the necessary medicines. But there can be situations where we will not be able to do a 
direct consultation especially in the present days of the pandemic. As a solution to that, our app 
contains an intelligent Virtual Doctor which will authenticate or validate the medicines or 
illness predicted by a normal doctor. The user can directly approach the Doctor by booking 
through online in the hospital of his own choice. There is also a provision for buying medicine 
which is mainly based on some terms and conditions, as the product that we sell is medicine 
which is sometimes called as drugs. The main advantage of this app is, it will help the user to 
find out the medicines that are available near to the pharmacies from where the user is using the 
app (through position navigation) and will sort the price of the medicine available in the 
pharmacies and helps the user to buy the medicine at the lowest price available near to him. 
Also, he is able to find the nearest labs and their respective tests. The user can also check his 
order or booking status. And another highlight is the user can also predict the diseases like lung 
cancer or anything by himself instantly. This project also includes a website for the admin, 
hospitals, labs, pharmacies and doctors to control their sections.

<b>PROBLEM DEFINITION </b><br><br>
Many people may face difficulties to consult a doctor, to purchase medicines and for 
other medical related purposes because of lack of transportation, financial issues, health 
problems, etc... Especially like in this time of pandemic it is not also safe to go outside our 
homes. Also, sometimes due to absence of proper treatment or awareness, people may fed up 
with seriously health issues in the course oof time. <br><br>
<b>OBJECTIVES</b><br><br>
The main objective of the project was to introduce a Virtual Doctor into the tips of our 
fingers who may consult and treat our issues easily. No one should face a situation of not 
getting a proper consultation or medicine in this digital world. Anyone can take an appointment 
or order medicines using the app without visiting hospitals or pharmacies. Other objectives of 
the project are: <br>
• Time efficient and cost effective: This app helps people to save their time and 
money and makes their lives more comfortable. <br>
• Pharmacy and Laboratory Services: People can order medicine from the nearest 
pharmacies or check for the tests in the nearest laboratories. <br>
• Predicting Cancer: People can check the status of their X-ray report with the help 
of SVM classifier<br><br>
<b> MOTIVATION</b><br><br>
 
 The motivation for doing this project was the present pandemic era where we all 
are facing difficulties to consult a doctor safely or to go outside our homes for purchasing 
medicines, taking appointments, etc. So, people need a more effective solution for an instant and 
safer solution for their health-related purposes.

<b>METHODOLOGY </b><br><br>
There are various project management methodologies. We choose the traditional and 
sequential methodology “Water fall” for doing our project. With this methodology, the tasks 
are sequenced that lead to a final deliverable product. With this, one task must be completed 
before the next one begins, in a connected sequence of items that add up to the overall 
deliverable. The reason behind the selection of this method was that every step is preplanned 
and laid out in the proper sequence.
